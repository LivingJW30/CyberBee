Cyber challenge for the February 23rd Hack@UCF general body meeting. Ping @Jack.py on Discord with the flag. 

Flag format: hack@ucf{*flag-name*}

## Background
Buzzing Wings Aerial Pollinators Platform (bWAPP) is in a bit of a buzz right now. Their brand new web based blog feature was hacked! As the new cyber intern, and the only cyber specialist in the company, it is your time to shine. 

Your supervisor needs you to take a look at a packet capture file taken during the attack to find out what happened and what the bad actor stole. There is rumors the bad actor may have breached the CEOs personal information. Can you find what the bad actor stole from the bWAPP CEO before he gets back from vacation?

## Guided questions
1. What is the login name of the user who attacked?
2. What kind of attack was used?
3. What is the login name of the CEO?
4. What did the bad actor steal

Note: You only need to submit the flag but hopefully these questions can help you work your way through the challenge.
